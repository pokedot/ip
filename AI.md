# Use of AI in the Project
I used Cursor to ask for suggestions on how the dimensions of my GUI components could be tweaked.
It was quick to read files and edit multiple lines of code and also provided justification for why the specific tweaks were made.
All I had to do was to accept all changes and open the GUI again to see if the results were satisfactory. The only tweak I made after
it was to increase the size of the icons. Overall, it saved me a lot of time in trying to figure out which attributes corresponded
to which part of the GUI.
